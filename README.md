## Usage 
Answer a series of terminal promps and behold, a README.md file is generated for your project!
    
## Motivation
A solid readme is a must have for any project so why not make a more convenient way to make one

## Why Make this?
I built this project to use to save time making high quality readme's for coding projects, as well as to practice javascript and using npm

## What problem does this solve?
This project solves the problem of launching projects with hastily made readmes made by hand from templates

## What did I learn while making this project?
I learned a lot about inquirer and fs and got some good practice using javascript arrow notation functions

## What really makes this project stand out?
You'd be hard pressed to find a lighter-weight more user friendly version of a readme generator
